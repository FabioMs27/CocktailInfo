### How it was made:

It uses the native URLSession framework for the api request. It implements the protocol-oriented approach, using generics and generic constraints so various different apis can be used as well as images can be downloaded. It contains error handling.<br/>
It decodes using the decodable protocol and coding keys.<br/>
It contains unit tests and it used the mock protocol approach. URLSession and URLSessionDataTask are subclassed so it can be tested without being asynchronous.<br/>
It uses storyboard for the UI and NSLayoutConstraints(also programmatically) and stack views for the Auto-layout.<br/>
The architectural pattern used is MVVM and it uses the reactive programming(Combine) approach for binding.<br/>
